# Dashboard for spatial datasets
This repository provides the code made by [Software Engineering](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/85177/software-engineering) students. The goal was to make a dashboard framework in Python, which allows the [Human Environmental and Transport Inspectorate (ILT)](https://www.ilent.nl/).

We provided the [studentteam](#authors) with the following additional wishes:
- Code written as universal/ modular as possible: we would be happy to re-use the set-up for future projects and to ensure consistency between different plots/visualizations within a dashboard.
- If possible, we would like to be able to exchange the code for re-use on other platforms (mainly R) with as little changes in the code as necessary.
- Take into account computational efficiency of loading, filtering, and rendering plots and tables , especially when it comes to the inclusion of several ‘heavy’ geo-plots.
- Include calls for data from PostGres/ PostGIS to support both computational efficiency as well as inclusion of automatically updated data sources.
- Ideas on how to visualize data and insights are appreciated.

## Getting started
